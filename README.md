## Automation Coding Project

This is a practical project where I apply test automation to solve real-world QA problems. You can review the code, run the tests, and view the test results and documentation.

## Docker

This is a practical project where I utilize Docker to run Playwright scripts in a containerized environment. Docker ensures that the scripts execute consistently across different systems, which is especially valuable for automated browser testing and CI/CD pipelines.
